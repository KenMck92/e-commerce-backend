# e-commerce-backend

## Description
In this challenge I implemented get, push, and delete routes for categories, products, and tags. I used an .env to hide my root information from anyone that viewed it. I have a db file that sources a schema file. Once the seed and server file is ran I can test it in insomnia. In insomnia when the I run a get all for categories, products, and tags I am displayed with all the information from my routes. I can get, delete or post a new category, product or tag using insomnia.
